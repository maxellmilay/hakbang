## What is Lakbai?

**Lakbai** is a web application that
visualizes our study which addresses the pressing challenges of urban mobility in the Philippines where traffic congestion, inadequate
infrastructure, and vehicle-centric development create barriers to sustainable mobility. To improve pedestrian
accessibility, we propose a dynamic, data-driven pedestrian accessibility index using fuzzy logic systems that integrate
expert opinions and real-time data inputs, including traffic, pedestrian congestion, and socio-demographic factors. The
systemâ€™s dynamic nature allows it to continuously adapt to local urban needs and patterns, ensuring that it reflects
real-time changes in traffic flow, environmental conditions, and pedestrian behavior. By focusing on environmental,
economic, and social sustainability, the model tailors its analysis to the unique characteristics of each area, providing
localized, actionable insights for policymakers and urban planners. The fuzzy system will model complex urban
conditions, leveraging expert input from infrastructure, environmental, and economic domains, while real-time data
ensures continuous updates to the accessibility index. The system will be deployed via an interactive dashboard that
visualizes dynamic pedestrian accessibility metrics, helping city planners make informed decisions to reduce vehicle
dependency, enhance walkability, and promote more equitable, sustainable urban environments. This approach ensures
that urban mobility solutions are not only adaptive but also aligned with the evolving needs of local communities.
